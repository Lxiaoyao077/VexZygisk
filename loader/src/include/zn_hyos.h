/* INFO: The HyperOS ("HYOS") runtime contract, as Zygisk Next defines it and
         YukiZygisk implements it.

         On HyperOS, applications are not forked by a zygote but by
         /system_ext/bin/hyos_spawner, which runs them on a Rust runtime of its
         own. There is no ART specialization to hook there - the hooks that
         announce one are what crashed the spawner and left every application
         unable to start - so the runtime carries the module contract instead: a
         module loaded into the spawner calls getRuntime(), gets this table, and
         registers an onAppSpecialized callback. The runtime then installs its
         own hooks in the spawner, and every application forked from it reaches
         the callback with its process name, package name and SELinux context.

         The shape of that is fixed by the ABI header (zygisk_next_api.h); this
         file is the rest of the contract: when the runtime exists, what a
         module has to look like to register, how the hooks are installed and
         rolled back, and how a specialization reaches the modules. */

         does not fit is refused rather than truncated, because half a package
