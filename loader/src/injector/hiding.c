/* INFO: What a hidden process has to stop naming in its own maps.

         The device decides a path: a module library only counts while it sits
         on /data, and a bind mount or an sdcard can put the same names on
         another device, where they are not ours to replace.

         The memfd is the exception, and it is checked first. A Zygisk Next
         library is copied into one to be dlopen'd at all, and a memfd is on no
         filesystem this process could hold a device number for - so the name
         is the whole of what identifies it, and it is one only this loader
         creates.

         Shared mappings are left alone. They are how a process reaches ashmem
         and the ART images, and turning one into a private copy would leave
         it holding a stale view of someone else's memory.

         The injector's own mapping is included, and it is the one that has to
         be: the target's linker loaded it, so the linker carries a module entry
         naming it, and an entry left pointing at nothing is a hidden process
         that takes down the next thing to walk its module list. Replacing the
         mapping this code runs from is safe for the reason the replacement is
         the same bytes at the same address - the copy is moved in with its
         permissions already set, and an instruction fetch after the move reads
         the same code it read before. */

/* INFO: The name the copy is given, and the reason it is that name.

         An anonymous executable mapping is a signature of its own: a scan for
         PROT_EXEC regions with nothing behind them finds this replacement
         without ever having to ask what it replaced. A memfd has a name, and a
         scan has to judge the name instead - so the copy is mapped from a memfd
         named after the runtime's own JIT cache, which is an executable mapping
         with no file of its own that every process already carries.

         "jit-zygote-cache" rather than "jit-cache" on purpose. The JIT cache
         belongs to the process, while the name carrying "zygote" is the one the
         zygote creates - so an application is the last place a scan expects a
         second one, and the last place this code is likely to collide with a
         real one. Colliding is what it must not do: see below.

         Every replacement in a process is a range of the same memfd, because
         the check that reads these names compares the inode behind each of them
         with the others. One memfd is one inode, so they agree. */
