/* INFO: The HyperOS runtime, as the contract describes it.

         The image is found in the process maps: on HyperOS the process hosting
         the runtime is not always the file /proc/self/exe names - it can be an
         app_process binary with the spawner image mapped into it - so the
         mapping is what identifies it, and the bytes behind the mapping are
         what confirm it. zn_spawner.h carries both predicates.

         Once found, the hooks the runtime needs are installed in that image
         through its PLT: a GOT entry always exists and is always writable,
         while rewriting the spawner's code for an inline hook can be refused by
         the policy it runs under. They are:
           - fork, so a child can be told apart from the spawner and given a

           - selinux_android_setcontext, which every specialization of a forked
             application goes through and which carries the three strings the
             contract promises the modules.
         A raw clone() would run none of them, which is why the runtime is armed
